### Exercise 8.1

> In Figure 8.3, we said that replacing the call to _exit with a call to exit might cause the standard output to be closed and printf to return âˆ’1. Modify the program to check whether your implementation behaves this way. If it does not, how can you simulate this behavior?

The program is here[click here](https://github.com/fatsheep9146/APUE-answers/tree/master/Chapter08/Exercise_08_01). In order to cause the standard output to be closed in exit, I use the function **atexit** to register a function **my\_exit** to **exit**. In the **my\_exit**, we call **fclose** funtion to close the standard output. Then if child process call **exit**, the **printf** in the parent process will be wrote into standard output.

If we want to prove that **printf** will return -1, we can use **write** system call instead of **printf** to write the return code of **printf** into file **STDOUT_FILENO**, because even thought standrad output is closed, the file is not closed.

You can run the program in your system, then change the **exit(0)** in child process to **_exit(0)** and run it again to see the differences.
